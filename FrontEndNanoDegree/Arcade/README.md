## How To Play

### Objective
The objective of the game is to cross the field and collect objects (gas, spark plug, oil) on the other side. Then return those items back to your toolbox, located where you originally started. Beware of the out of control lawn mowers that will mow you down and take a life.

### Movement
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move up|down|left|right to dodge the lawn mowers and navigate your character on the screen.
